            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>  &nbsp;Hello, my name is Nick Amstutz. I graduated from The Ohio State University with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Computer and Information Science. 
                It was through my minor that I gained a passion for computer science and comptuer programming. <br><br>
                &nbsp;Post college I have begun working for a software company as a Conversion Engineer. In this role I carefully create extract and update scripts in SQL Server Management Studio
                (SSMS) to stage legacy data and load this data through my companies software to ensure the data is clean and functioning with our system. Once our project goes live,
                it is important that there is a foundation of data to work with and that the integrity of the data is maintained from the legacy system. <br><br>
                &nbsp;Outside of work, I enjoy running with my dog, watching anime (personal favorite is AOT), and working through the Full Stack Engineer Course on Codecademy!
